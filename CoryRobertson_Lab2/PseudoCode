1. We create variables for each type of denomination such as quarters, dimes, etc.
2. Then we take input from the user for each of these denominations.
3. To add the currencies up we take them by their integer amount (e.g. we have 3 quarters so quarters = 3, not 0.75) and we multiply it by 0.25 to get 0.75, and add that number in a money variable.
4. Do the above step for the rest of the denominations of money.
5. Ask the user for their choice of item.
6. Depending on their choice, we check if the item is in stock, and if the user has enough money for the item.
7. If both checks pass we give them the item and subtract the cost from their money and decrement the stock of the item.
8. We then do the reverse of step 3 and take the amount of divisible coins as a whole number in the money to find out how many coins of each type to give to the user.
9. Display to user each coin amount.
