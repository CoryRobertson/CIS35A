In order for this project to function we need a couple things as follows:
A class to store the workers data such as salary, pay, rate, name, etc...
A class to run and use this data and then wrap it to the user to give the user ability to customize pay rates and such.

We should have a while loop state machine in the main class that is waiting for the user to be done inputing new workers and then print out the table.
The flow chart should be as follows:
User chooses to add a worker -> user enters name -> user enters the pay type -> user enters data specific to that pay type -> user decides on giving bonus -> worker added to the table -> restart this loop
Once the user is done looping through that we then print it out in a nice little table
