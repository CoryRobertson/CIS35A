Lab 1 Sum the Digits in an Integer
Due Thursday by 11:30pm | Points 10
Problem Description
Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14.

Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.

Here is a sample run:

Enter a number between 0 and 1000: 999

The sum of the digits is 27
